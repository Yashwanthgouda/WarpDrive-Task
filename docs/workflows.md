  |       |---> Check Duplicate Attendance
  |       |        |
  |       |---> Create Attendance Record
  |       |        |
  |<--- Attendance Confirmation
  |       |        |
```

### Process Steps
1. Admin accesses Attendance Management

3. Views list of registered students
4. Marks students as present/absent
5. System validates:
   - Student is registered for the event
   - Attendance not already marked
6. Attendance record is created
7. Admin receives confirmation

## 4. Feedback Submission Workflow

### Sequence Diagram
```
Student → System → Database
   |        |        |
   |---> Submit Feedback Request
   |        |        |
   |        |---> Check Attendance
   |        |        |
   |        |---> Check Duplicate Feedback
   |        |        |
   |        |---> Validate Rating
   |        |        |
   |        |---> Create Feedback Record
   |        |        |
   |<--- Feedback Confirmation
   |        |        |
```

### Process Steps
1. Student attends an event
2. Student accesses the Feedback section
3. Selects an attended event
4. Provides rating (1-5 stars) and optional comment
5. System validates:
   - Student attended the event
   - Feedback not already submitted
   - Rating is valid (1-5)
6. Feedback is recorded
7. Student receives confirmation

## 5. Report Generation Workflow

### Sequence Diagram
```
Admin → System → Database
  |       |        |
  |---> Generate Report Request
  |       |        |
  |       |---> Execute Query
  |       |        |
  |       |---> Process Data
  |       |        |
  |       |---> Format Results
  |       |        |
  |<--- Report Data
  |       |        |
```

### Process Steps
1. Admin accesses Reports section
2. Selects report type:
   - Event Popularity
   - Student Participation
   - Attendance Summary
   - Feedback Summary
   - Top Active Students
   - Event Type Analysis
3. Applies filters if needed
4. Clicks "Generate Report"
5. System executes appropriate query
6. Data is processed and formatted
7. Report is displayed in table format

## 6. Multi-College Data Management

### Data Isolation Strategy
- Each college has its own students and events
- Student IDs are unique within each college
- Events are scoped to specific colleges
- Reports can be filtered by college
- Cross-college analytics are available for system-wide insights

### College Management
1. Colleges are created by system administrators
2. Each college gets a unique code
3. Students are associated with their college
4. Events are created within college context
5. Reports can be generated per college or system-wide

## 7. Error Handling Workflows

### Common Error Scenarios
1. **Duplicate Registration**
   - Error: "Student is already registered for this event"
   - Resolution: Check existing registrations before allowing new ones

2. **Event Capacity Exceeded**
   - Error: "Event is at full capacity"
   - Resolution: Check current registrations against max_participants

3. **Invalid Event Status**
   - Error: "Event is not active for registration"
   - Resolution: Check event status before allowing registrations

4. **Attendance Without Registration**
   - Error: "Student is not registered for this event"
   - Resolution: Require registration before marking attendance

5. **Feedback Without Attendance**
   - Error: "Student must attend the event to provide feedback"
   - Resolution: Check attendance before allowing feedback

## 8. Data Validation Workflows

### Input Validation
- **Email Format**: Valid email addresses for students
- **Date Validation**: Start date must be before end date
- **Rating Validation**: Feedback ratings must be 1-5
- **Required Fields**: All mandatory fields must be provided
- **Unique Constraints**: Prevent duplicate data where appropriate

### Business Rule Validation
- **Event Timing**: Cannot register for past events
- **Capacity Limits**: Respect maximum participant limits
- **Status Transitions**: Proper event status management
- **Data Integrity**: Maintain referential integrity across tables

## 9. Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
- Indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient JOIN operations for reports
- Pagination for large datasets
- Query optimization for complex reports

### Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Implement pagination for large lists
- Optimize API response times
- Use efficient data structures

## 10. Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Input sanitization to prevent SQL injection
- Validation of all user inputs
- Proper error handling without information leakage
- Secure API endpoints

### Access Control
- Role-based access (Admin vs Student)
- College-level data isolation
- Secure session management
- API authentication (ready for implementation)

## 11. Scalability Considerations

### Current Scale Support
- 50 colleges
- 500 students per college
- 20 events per semester per college
- Total: ~25,000 students, ~1,000 events per semester

### Future Scaling
- Database partitioning by college
- Horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- Microservices architecture for large deployments

## 12. Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics
- Event registration rates
- Attendance percentages
- Student engagement levels
- Feedback scores and trends
- System performance metrics

### Reporting Capabilities
- Real-time dashboard updates
- Historical trend analysis
- Comparative analytics across colleges
- Export capabilities for external analysis
